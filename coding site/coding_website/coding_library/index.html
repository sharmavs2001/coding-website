										<p>Python is omnipresent and used in many areas of software development, with no sign of slowing down.Python has first-class integration with C/C++ and can seamlessly offload the CPU heavy tasks to C/C++. Also, Python gives powerful toolset for Mathematics, Statistics, and Computational Science with various libraries like NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Scikit-Learn. As a result, Python dominates the Machine Learning/Deep Learning/Data Science landscape and other Scientific domain.<br><br></p>

										<p><br>JavaScript is one of the most widely used programming languages in the world and runs on virtually everywhere: Browsers, Servers, Mobile Devices, Cloud, Containers, Micro-controllers.JavaScript is the undisputed king in Browser programming.JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm.It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing.</p>

										<p>In 2000, Tech giant Microsoft decided to create their Object Oriented C like programming language C# as part of their .NET initiative, which will be managed (run on a Virtual Machine like Java). The veteran language designer Anders Hejlsberg designed C# as part of Microsoft's Common Language Initiative (CLI) platform where many other (mainly Microsoft's languages) compiled into an intermediate format which runs on a Runtime named Common Language Runtime (CLR).
During the early days, C# was criticized as an imitation of Java.</p>

										<p>As C gave low-level access to memory and compiled to Machine instructions, it is one of the fastest and most powerful programming languages.
C gives full control over the underlying hardware. C program can run on every platform and take advantage of every kind of hardware, whether it is GPU, TPU, Container, Cloud, Mobile devices, or Microcontroller.
C is one of the "Programming languages of the Language," i.e., compilers of many other programming languages like Ruby, PHP, Python have been written in C.<br></p>

										<p>Bjarne Stroustrup has worked with Dennis Ritchie (creator of C) in Bell Lab during the 1970s. Over time, C++ has evolved into a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language. Like C, C++ also offers low-level memory access and directly compiled to machine instructions.
C++ also offers full control over hardware but with the cost of accidental complexity and does not provide language-level support for memory safety and 
concurrency safety. Also, C++ offers too many features.</p>
